# LogicLoop 🌀

> From "It just works" to "I know why it works."

LogicLoop is a systematic framework for mastering technical concepts by reverse-engineering functional code through AI-assisted auditing.

## The Workflow
1. **The Black Box:** Start with a working script.
2. **The Synthesis:** Write your mental model of how it works.
3. **The Audit:** Use AI to cross-reference your model against the code.
4. **The Refinement:** Produce a high-fidelity "White Box" document.

## Why?
Documentation usually outpaces understanding. LogicLoop ensures your mental model and the implementation are perfectly aligned.
